# ADS GROUP PROJECT

ADS Group Project aims to explore the prevalence and death rate of diseases related to the use of alcohol and opioids.

## Tools Used

Please install the **R 4+** to run this project and use Latex to knit R Markdown file. This is a R-based project and you should first install "rmarkdown", "dplyr", "tidyr" and "ggplot2" package.

## Files in Repository

Here is a brief introduction about the files in our repository:

- our project R Markdown file ("ADS2_GroupExercise2.Rmd")
- three pictures ("country.png","percentage.png", "world.png") and table ("substance_use.csv") used in the R Markdown file
- PDF file ("ADS2_GroupExercise2.pdf") knitted from R Markdown file using MiKTeX

## Reminder about knitting

Before knit: First put the table used ("substance_use.csv") to the same directory where your R Markdown file is.  

*P.S. If you cannot knit because of the pictures not found, you may alternatively download the pictures from our repository and put them to the same directory where your R Markdown file is.*

After knit: The output will be PDF document. When we worked on this project, we found that the output might look different when knitting on different computers. This might due to how you knit it (using tinyTex or LaTex). To emphasize, the PDF document we uploaded was knitted using MiKTeX.
